# GitHub Pages Slideshow with [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)

This template is made from [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark), an open source tool to help create and display slideshows from markdown. For questions, see [Remark's documentation](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

The most important things to know are:
- Enable GitHub Pages from `master` for the slides to work
- Once enabled, the slides will be visible at `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME/#1`, like https://brianamarie.github.io/slideshow-on-pages/#1
- Edit the `index.html` file to edit the slides
- Slides are separated by `----`
- Presenter notes after `???` within one slide
- Toggle presenter notes during presentation with `P`
